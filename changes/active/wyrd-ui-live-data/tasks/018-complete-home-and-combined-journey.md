# TASK-018 — Complete Home and combined live user journey

## Outcome and Value

Home agrees with live underlying pages and a complete login-to-verification story works with tenant isolation and SvelteKit server loading.

Owns AC-015, AC-016, AC-017, AC-018. AC-018 is a per-page obligation; AC-017 typed consumer/schema evidence also applies.
The preceding task is an acceptance-order dependency: the user requires one page gate before the next. Shared software dependencies are identified in the reuse map; this order does not authorize unrelated rewrites.

## Owners, Scope, Consumers, and Prohibited Changes

UI paths below are relative to `crates/wyrd/wyrd-server/wyrd-ui`; server paths are relative to `crates/wyrd/wyrd-server`. Named symbols and tests describe inspected ownership, not a private-file allowlist. Use `wyrd-implement` and, for UI edits, `wyrd-ui`.

| Capability | Existing owner/symbol | Inspected callers/tests | Missing behavior | Selected extension | New machinery justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Complete Home and combined live user journey | `WyrdClient.home`, Home server load; all existing page/auth/scope owners integrated in tasks 001–017 | Home summary links, accepted page cases and shared identity/SDK setup; generated consumer check and server session boundary | Operational Home remains partial until signal/verification pages land; integrated story and cross-page isolation need final proof. | Compose already-integrated live projections into existing Home and add one combined browser story using the same setup. | None: no second orchestration harness or durable Home summary store. |
| Authenticated loading and presentation | `hooks.server.ts`, `BrowserSession.api/context`, existing `+page.server.ts` loads and `WyrdClient` | Production auth integration tests; current route/component consumers; generated operation types | Current mock domain methods do not provide this page’s authoritative asynchronous live data | Extend the current server-only facade/load and retain SvelteKit-generated page types | No duplicate session, transport, contract owner or page-data schema. |

Keep native Card/Verifier identity and exact attribution. Effective tenant/permissions come from the current verified session, never from URL scope; secrets remain server-only. Preserve actual server permission decisions and non-blocking audit staging. The BFF never reads databases/object storage directly or replaces registry/verification/query engines.
Do not add public/persisted contracts, migrations, compatibility routes, signal read APIs, a global service selector, Changes, custom dashboards, raw Query functionality or paid/external provider requirements. Existing foundation tasks are historical context only. The audited extra Changes/dashboard/GenAI/styleguide routes are outside this page-gate scope.

## Required Server and BFF Contracts

[Source-backed route audit](../route-audit.md) defines operation inputs/responses, permissions, structured errors, canonical query schemas and the route-to-task matrix. Reuse those mounted contracts; do not generate types from this planning table or create a parallel `/ui/*` API family.

| Boundary | Required behavior and contract |
|---|---|
| Existing BFF route | GET /t/{tenantKey} and the existing routes accepted in tasks 002–017. |
| URL/action inputs | Current tenant plus equivalent service/time scopes carried by summary links; navigation/session invalidation. |
| Existing server operations | S-CARDS plus existing exact Card/control reads and POST /v1/query; no new Home summary endpoint. |
| Required integration gap | Complete Home by composing bounded already-integrated owners, then validate one combined browser story and targeted cross-tenant/session checks. |
| Analytical result contract | Q-TRACES/Q-LOGS/Q-METRICS/Q-RESULTS/Q-TASKS/Q-DRIFT as supported. Operational counts/links agree with underlying pages under equivalent scope; unsupported registry totals remain truthful. |

Use generated HTTP operation types and SvelteKit-generated route data types. Protected domain reads remain server-only with current session authority. SvelteKit loads call the facade directly; no internal proxy HTTP hop or page-specific JSON handler is currently required. Browser OAuth redirects/device approval retain their existing protocol paths. Test inputs, returned shape/status/media type, forbidden/missing identities and URL restoration—not merely that a route returns 200.

## Approach

1. Complete Home operational/verification summaries from existing bounded live owners, without unbounded total scans.
2. Drive one combined login → register → inspect → execute → telemetry → verification → Home browser story on the shared setup.
3. Repeat targeted restricted-user/overlapping-tenant/URL manipulation checks and session-change navigation.
4. Collect per-page generated-contract, initial HTML, network, usability and acceptance evidence; preserve earlier independent gate selectors.

## Ordered Implementation Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — Complete operational Home

**Behavior.** After real executions/judgments, Home summaries/counts and scoped links agree with underlying pages; no operational fixture data remains. Mapped obligations: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006, REQ-007, REQ-008, REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-011, REQ-012, REQ-013, REQ-014, REQ-015, REQ-016, REQ-017, REQ-018, REQ-019, REQ-020, REQ-021, REQ-022, REQ-023, REQ-024, REQ-025; AC-015, AC-016, AC-017, AC-018.

**RED.** The focused combined case first fails on partial/unavailable or inconsistent Home operational content. Grow the exact focused case `live UI combined journey` in this order, using:

```bash
WYRD_IDENTITY_TARGET=ui WYRD_IDENTITY_FILTER='live UI combined journey' mise run test:identity:journey
```

**GREEN.** Compose existing live summaries into Home with accurate populations and navigation. Rerun this case with all earlier scenario assertions retained. For shared behavior, rerun the focused consumer regression below.

**REFACTOR.** Simplify within the existing owner; reuse current controls, types and helpers. Preserve validation, error handling and earlier scenario evidence. Already-correct branches receive regression proof, not an artificial failure.

### Scenario 2 — End-to-end authority and ergonomics

**Behavior.** The full rendered story works, relevant scope survives investigations, filters are clear/changeable/clearable, and restricted/other-tenant requests leak no rows/details/secrets. Mapped obligations: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006, REQ-007, REQ-008, REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-011, REQ-012, REQ-013, REQ-014, REQ-015, REQ-016, REQ-017, REQ-018, REQ-019, REQ-020, REQ-021, REQ-022, REQ-023, REQ-024, REQ-025; AC-015, AC-016, AC-017, AC-018.

**RED.** Add combined browser interaction/network/SSR and manipulation checks before fixing any integration seam. Grow the exact focused case `live UI combined journey` in this order, using:

```bash
WYRD_IDENTITY_TARGET=ui WYRD_IDENTITY_FILTER='live UI combined journey' mise run test:identity:journey
```

**GREEN.** Repair the owning shared seam only, retain accepted page behaviors and gather final evidence without expanding product scope. Rerun this case with all earlier scenario assertions retained. For shared behavior, rerun the focused consumer regression below.

**REFACTOR.** Simplify within the existing owner; reuse current controls, types and helpers. Preserve validation, error handling and earlier scenario evidence. Already-correct branches receive regression proof, not an artificial failure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Both ordered scenarios pass using the applicable owners, including exclusions and edge/failure branches; the separate live page acceptance gate proves all user-visible branches against real data.
- Every required BFF input reaches the identified upstream operation/query with correct scope; generated response/schema mapping and denied/missing/error behavior are recorded in the page evidence.
- The page is accepted independently against SDK/HTTP/Bifrost evidence in the shared disposable setup with mock identity/content disabled. Domain evidence is registered/emitted/evaluated through public pathways, never inserted as prepared results.
- Primary content or truthful empty/error state exists in initial HTML before hydration. URL controls invoke SvelteKit server loads; hydration does not redundantly fetch initial data. Protected upstream calls remain server-only. Preloads are read-only/bounded and every navigation revalidates session authority.
- Context is visible, changeable and clearable where applicable. Continuation links preserve applicable service/time/selection state; relationship links select the target’s identity. Filters, pagination and counts agree with authoritative reads under equivalent settled scope.
- Missing, denied, unavailable and schema-invalid data never silently falls back to fixtures. Work remains bounded and supported terminal/visibility semantics are preserved.
- Record a human usability pass or concrete corrected issues with scrubbed local screenshots; review control discoverability, scope clarity, back/refresh behavior, accessible interaction and error recovery.

## Expected Write Set and Consumer Closure

Final Home facade/load/presentation, shared navigation seams only if failing, combined browser case and compact evidence references. No broad new harness or unrelated usability redesign.

Close callers, tests, fixtures/setup, package/lock/config and runtime consumers of each changed owner. Shared/private helpers may move only when that earns a smaller cohesive implementation. The existing identity host must discover and forward the planned exact case selector; adding a split test file includes discovery changes so the command cannot select zero tests.
When changing a shared projection or method to asynchronous live IO, update every in-scope load/caller and retain mock/component behavior. Analytical result schemas are not HTTP DTOs: validate canonical columns/types before interpretation and reuse existing SDK decoding.

## Verification and Evidence

The following exact journey case is planned under the inspected test owner/lane; introduce its assertions before implementing missing behavior. Correct existing branches are verification-only evidence. This is a mixed task when a generic implementation already satisfies part of the page.

```bash
WYRD_IDENTITY_TARGET=ui WYRD_IDENTITY_FILTER='live UI combined journey' mise run test:identity:journey
mise exec -- pnpm --dir crates/wyrd/wyrd-server/wyrd-ui run check
mise exec -- pnpm --dir crates/wyrd/wyrd-server/wyrd-ui run build
```

Run `mise run codegen:check` when HTTP generation/consumption changes, and record which generated operation types the page consumes. Identify canonical analytical columns/types and prove schema/terminal mapping where used.
For actual Rust changes, run `mise run fmt` and `mise run lints`; for changed dependency/owner boundaries run `mise run check:deps`. Add only the narrow owning format/lint/test checks justified by the actual write set.
Do not run full identity/SDK journey suites or a broad aggregate as this task’s gate. Integrated verification belongs once to change review. Existing authentication/audit behavior needs regression proof, not manufactured RED.
Retain initial-response/network evidence, expected data identities and exclusions, readiness bounds and a scrubbed usability review. Record page pass/fail and mapped obligations; do not claim an isolated page proves the whole change.

## Material Stop Conditions

Stop for specification revision if the required outcome genuinely needs a new public/persisted contract, migration, permission/audience change, durability/freshness guarantee, engine behavior or ownership exception. Do not silently substitute a new read API or unbounded scan for a missing contract.
Report a concrete blocker if repository-managed setup cannot supply the required real evidence safely or a canonical schema cannot support truthful required presentation. Reversible private mapping/tooling choices remain implementation-owned; correct mock assumptions rather than inventing domain state.
