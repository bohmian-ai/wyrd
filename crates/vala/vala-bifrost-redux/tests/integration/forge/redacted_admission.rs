/// Every admitted plan publishes its own operation onto the current head.
///
/// The attempt is the unit of planning, not of commit: one plan set is derived
/// from one table read, and each plan is then rewritten and published on its
/// own. What that has to produce is a chain, not a batch — one operation and
/// one snapshot per plan, each committed onto the head its predecessor left, so
/// a plan that fails costs only itself and a plan that succeeds is durable
/// immediately.
///
/// The table is seeded so the attempt has at least three plans to admit, which
/// is what separates "published independently" from "published once".
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics when the attempt publishes fewer operations than it admitted plans,
/// when two plans share an operation identity, when the published snapshots do
/// not form one linear chain over the base the attempt planned against, or when
/// an input the attempt rewrote is still live.
