class WyrdTestServer:
    """Wyrd in-process test server context manager (testing feature only).

    Starts a real Wyrd server bound to a loopback TCP socket backed by an
    embedded Postgres fixture. Use as a context manager; ``bootstrap_service``
    is only valid inside the ``with`` block.

    When ``mutate_env=True`` (default), the context manager sets
    ``WYRD_SERVER_URL``, ``WYRD_GRPC_URL``, and ``WYRD_API_KEY`` in the process
    environment for the duration of the block and restores original values (or
    removes them) on exit. Use ``mutate_env=False`` when running parallel test
    suites that manage these vars externally.

    ``cleanup`` is reserved for a future teardown-skip feature; currently ignored
    (the server and embedded Postgres are always cleaned up on exit).
